Redmine Email Fetcher
=====================

This redmine plugin extends the Redmine [Receiving emails](http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/RedmineReceivingEmails#Fetching-emails-from-a-POP3-server) 
functionality by allowing the configuration of email accounts from where emails should be periodically fetched.

__Features__:

 * Stores IMAP and POP3 email configurations.
 * Associate each email configuration with the desired project, tracker and optionally with categories and priority.   
 * Allow manual email connection test and fetch.
 * Adds a task which allows the cronjob to fetch emails from all active email configurations.
 * Allows a configuration to be inactivated to stop its emails synchronisation with Redmine.

__Restrictions__:

* The plugin requires a Ruby version equal or higher than 1.9.0.
* The plugin requires a Rails version equal or higher than 3.0.0.
* The plugin requires a Redmine version equal or higher than 2.1.0.

__Remarks__:

* The plugin is prepared and intended to run with any IMAP and POP3 email account, however
  some issues can accur due to security certificates.
* When using SSL, please check that the machine has the proper certificates installed
  by running the following terminal command:
  * `openssl s_client -connect HOST:PORT`
* The Categories and Priority fields are free text, so if you update their names it is your responsibility
  to update them accordingly in this plugin administration

Usage
-----

### Configuration

Open `Administration > Fetch emails` to access the plugin configuration:

**Email Configuration Attributes:**

+ **Configuration type** - Sets Email account configuration type:
  - **IMAP**
  - **POP3**
+ **Is configuration active?** - Specify if this email account is active and should
  be synchronized:
  - **True** - Task `fetch_all_emails` should synchronize this email account 
  - **False** - Task `fetch_all_emails` should ignore this email account
+ **Last successful fetch at** - (read only) Date and time of the last synchronization of this 
  email account with Redmine.


**Email Attributes:**

+ **Host** - The IMAP or POP3 server host (e.g. `127.0.0.1`).
+ **Port** - The IMAP or POP3 server port. Eg., `993`.
+ **SSL** - SSL usage? (Default: `True`) [Options: `True`, `False`]
+ **Username** - The IMAP or POP3 email account username (e.g. `it@domain.com`).
+ **Password** - The IMAP or POP3 email account password.
+ **Folder name** - The email folder name from where the emails should be fetched:
  - **IMAP** - Any folder name is possible, but the test function will validate that 
    this folder is reachable after login) (e.g. `REDMINE`).
  - **POP3** - Since this is an old protocol, only the `INBOX` folder is allowed
    (in fact you can't change this option)
+ **On success move to folder (IMAP only)** - (optional) This IMAP attribute allows configuration 
  of where successfully received emails should be moved to, instead of deleting them (e.g. `ARCHIVE`).
+ **On failure move to folder (IMAP only)** - (optional) This IMAP attribute allows configuration 
  of where ignored emails should be moved (e.g. `IGNORED`).
+ **Use APOP? (POP3 only)** - This POP3 attribute allows specifying if APOP 
  authentication should be used (default: `false`).
+ **On failure delete email (POP3 only)** - This POP3 attribute allows specifying whether emails which 
  could not be processed successfully are deleted from the server  
  (default: `false` - default behaviour is to leave them on the server).


**Unknown Sender Actions (in Redmine):**

+ **Method for unknown users** - How to handle emails from an unknown user where 
  ACTION can be one of the following values:
  - **accept** - the sender is considered as an anonymous user and the email is accepted (default).
                 If you choose this option you must activate the Custom field `owner-email`, where
                 the sender email address will be stored. Without this field activated, the email fetch will fail,
                 since this information is required to send information back to the sender 
                 (the [Redmine Helpdesk plugin](https://github.com/jfqd/redmine_helpdesk) may be a nice addition).
  - **ignore** - The email is ignored.
  - **create** - A user account is created for the sender (username/password are sent back to the user) 
    and the email is accepted.
+ **Use no_account_notice** - Suppressing account generation notification (default `False`).
+ **Use no_permission_check** - Disable permission checking when receiving the email (default `True`).
+ **Default group for new reporters** - (optional) Automatically adding new users to some group(s)
  (e.g. `group1,group2`).


**Default Issue creation (in Redmine) Attributes:**

+ **Tracker** - Target tracker (in case no tracker is specified in email content).
+ **Category name** - (optional) Name of the default category (in case no category is specified in email content).
+ **Priority name** - (optional) Name of the default priority (in case no priority is specified in email content).
+ **allow_override** - (optional) Allow email content to override attributes specified by previous options
  ATTRS is a comma separated list of attributes (e.g. `project,tracker,category,priority`).
+ **Project** - Target default project (in case no project is specified in email content).

### Rake tasks

The following tasks are available:

    # rake -T redmine:plugins:email_fetcher
    rake redmine:plugins:email_fetcher:fetch_all_emails   # Fetch all active email accounts emails to Redmine
    
This task can be used for periodic synchronization.
For example:

    # etch all active email accounts emails to Redmine @ every 5 minutes
    */5 * * * *   www-data /usr/bin/rake -f /opt/redmine/Rakefile --silent redmine:plugins:email_fetcher:fetch_all_emails RAILS_ENV=production 2>&- 1>&-

The tasks recognize three environment variables:
+ **DRY_RUN** - Performs a run without changing the database.
+ **LOG_LEVEL** - Controls the rake task verbosity.
  The possible values are:
  - **silent**: Nothing is written to the output.
  - **error**: Only errors are written to the output.
  - **change**: Only writes errors and changes made to the user/group's base.
  - **debug**: Detailed information about the execution is visible to help
               identify errors. This is the default value.
